# Account

An account is either a personal account such as a client/supplier account or a impersonal account such as a income statement/balance account.

## Personal Account

### Open Postings

All personal accounts show open positions (postings that are not squared with other postings) by default.

### Summary Account

This is the account that is used to summarize the balance of multiple personal accounts. Usually, accounting structures use summary accounts for domestic customers, intra-community (EU) and third countries.

## Impersonal Account

### Taxes

### Cost Center

#### Requirement

You can define that either:

1. No cost center is allowed
2. A cost center is allowed but not required
3. A cost center is required

#### Default

You can define a default cost center to be used when creating a posting. This cost center can be manually modified by the user during the posting.

#### Mandatory

You can define a mandatory cost center. This defines a default cost center that cannot be changed.

### Cost Object

#### Requirement

You can define that either:

1. No cost object is allowed
2. A cost object is allowed but not required
3. A cost object is required

#### Default

You can define a default cost object to be used when creating a posting. This cost object can be manually modified by the user during the posting.

#### Mandatory

### Open Postings

This makes the account show open positions (postings that are not squared with other postings).

> This only effects postings after this setting is changed.

### Manual Posting

By default no manual postings are allowed on impersonal accounts. By enabling them accountants can manually perform postings on this account.

### Report Indicators

Some tax forms and survey forms require accounting statistics. By defining the report indicator of the corresponding form they will automatically include the information from this account at the respective position.
